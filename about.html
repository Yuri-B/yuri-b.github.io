          <p>
            I have always followed the philosophy of "Today - Ridicule, Tomorrow - Really Cool", which basically means that the wildest ideas today might actually work very well tomorrow. I started drawing as a kid, but then got massively put off fine art, architecture and graphic design. I have decided to explore much less traditional applications of drawing. My work revolves around making computers generate images in 2D, 3D and when I will learn it, Unreal Engine. Who knows, it might eventually become The Matrix. I'm also fascinated by invention and support the idea of radical improvement. I'm not a big fan of disruptive innovation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm not really into sticking to a particular lifestyle. I enjoy a bit of rock climbing and occasional road trip, both in a car and a self-customized e-bike. My vision of hell involves sticking to a very rigid routine and going to Church service every Sunday.

                Made an attempt to create videogame with my classmates, and actually completed a 5 minute long cartoon that was animated with sprites on 3D Studio MAX. During that time, I have produced various <a href="projects/art.html" target="_blank">artwork</a>.

                After unsuccessful attempt to create video games and being put off art, I have followed advice to channel my skills towards something "serious" and "in demand". Learned engineering, CAD software and proper ways to design things.

                  Worked in start-ups in Dublin.
                </span><br/>
                Got involved in start-ups, because those were the only businesses I could get paid work in during a recession in Dublin. Done a wide variety of freelance and contract projects, from 3D Printing to Interface Design. Had an idea for a website creator app, and then joined a start-up which created <a href="https://www.fluidui.com" target="_blank">one of the first HTML5 mock-up tools</a>. Up until 2014, I have bet my future career on skeumorphics.

                Collaborated on development of a <a href="http://smartvote.ie/" target="_blank">voting tool</a> which was used in several public election campaigns in Ireland. I thought that by participating in improvements of politics and working in tech start-ups, I could get bragging rights to a cheap mortgage in Ireland.

                </span><br/>
                Made an attempt to introduce blockchain technology to buying and selling of art. Eventually learned that tech would not solve problems for artists. Also got back into filling my sketchbook with random ideas.

                </span><br/>
                Took a leap of faith to learn 3D modeling and animation properly, so I could get back to creating concept design, video sequences and animations professionally and get paid for it. Studied it at <a href="https://www.vcad.ca/" target="_blank">VCAD</a> in Vancouver, mostly online from home.
