            This was my thesis project during my studies in <a href="http://www.dit.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin Institute of Technology</a>. I have identified a problem to solve, conducted user research, evaluated user requirements and produced a working prototype.

          <h2 class="text-orange">Project Goal</h2>
          <p>The goal of a thesis in Bachelor of Science of Product Design was to create a hardware product with some intellectual property.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <div class="full-width-inner content-left">
          <h3 class="text-purple">Initial Research</h3>
          <p>Most of initial research was spent on finding a subject for thesis. Subjects were drawn from list of topics, and the most impactful one was chosen after extensive brainstorming.</p>

          <p>I have chosen eye strain because that was the probem that I was most familiar with.</p>

          <p>Then, research was planned in steps. The goal was to impose a time limit on each step of research.</p>

          <p class="emphasis text-orange"><b>Fun fact :</b> a large part of research involved patent search, and this is an essential step in hardware development, before any design will be done.</p>

        <div class="full-width-inner content-right">
          <h3 class="text-purple">Domain Research</h3>
          <p>Once the concept was narrowed down, the following steps were executed to get a better understanding of the problems behind eye strain:</p>

          <p class="emphasis">
            Interview with experts at National Optometry Centre<br />
            <br />
            Conduct surveys with active computer users, such as gamers and other students<br />
            <br />
            Evaluate pros and cons of present solutions<br />
            <br />
            Evaluate future solutions which will disrupt existing eye strain reduction technologies such as brain-computer interface<br />
          </p>

          <p>A matrix of potential solutions was drawn up and all solutions were thoroughly evaluated.</p>

          <p class="text-orange">Conclusion was to create a system which observes the user with a camera and guides him/her towards a less eye straining posture with a software app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="full-width-inner content-left">
          <h3 class="text-purple">Design Resolution of Camera</h3>
          <p>Concept resolution was done by using mouldable clay to sketch out suitable pieces rapidly and test them. The aim was to create a webcam which could house essential equipment and attach onto any computer or a laptop.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Design Aesthetics</h3>
          <p>Once the basic concept was resolved, the aesthetics of both hardware and software design were considered. The theme was around utility, enforcement and warning. </p>

          <p>For the camera, the concept was created and evaluated in SolidWorks. The aim was to create a camera which could be placed on any monitor and withstand the stresses and strains of continuous usage.</p>

          <p>For the software application, the aim was to create a pop-up which appeared when user was in an eye straining position. The pop-up would instruct the user to move into a less eye straining position. </p>
          <p>Interface contained pop-ups, which required very little interaction.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Execution</h3>
          <p>The camera was built by embedding a cheap webcam into a 3D printed case.</p>
          <p>Interface was built in <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html" target="_blank">LabView</a>, where camera interactions were programmed. LabView contained a machine vision tool which helped to detect colours. I have created a programme where LabView detected a selection of skin tones. If the user was wearing something which was exactly the same colour as his/her face, the programme would not be accurate. </p>

        <h2>Project Outcome</h2>

        <p>After being nominated as a runner-up in an <a href="https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/louth-grads-shortlisted-for-digital-hub-contest-26955931.html" target="_blank">Irish digital media competition</a> , I have made an attempt to pitch it to a <a href="https://www.ndrc.ie/" target="_blank">start-up accelerator</a>. The pitch was not successful. However, one part of the project became standard features on many laptops : <b>screen which changes brightness depending on external lighting</b></p>
